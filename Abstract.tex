\begin{abstract}
The conception of multi-view design has been proposed to respond to currently complex system's requirements. It relied on Model-based approach (MBA) and involved several modeling languages (such as SysML, AADL, etc.). However, we are not able to integrate all of them into a mono design platform. Hence, we proposed a new approach to blending them seamlessly and extended their capabilities without extending development platform, that we named co-design operation. Firstly, we are established in engineering framework --Capella which adopts SysML as a modeling language. Furthermore, we proposed a set of transformation operators that can construct an interpretation system to automatically translate  Capella designs into AADL develop environment (OASTE), and then it can refine models and performance verification and validation respectively. We illustrate our approach with an experimental of (engine??) design processes represented as scenarios.
