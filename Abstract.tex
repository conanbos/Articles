The conception of multi-view design has been proposed to respond to currently complex system's requirements. It relied on Model-based approach (MBA) and involved several modeling languages (such as SysML, AADL, etc.). However, we are not able to integrate all of them into a mono design platform. Hence, we proposed a new approach to blending them seamlessly and extended their capabilities without extending development platform, that we named co-design operation. Firstly, we are established in engineering framework --Capella which adopts SysML as a modeling language. Furthermore, we proposed a set of transformation operators that can construct an interpretation system to automatically translate  Capella designs into AADL develop environment (OASTE), and then it can refine models and performance verification and validation respectively. We illustrate our approach with an experimental of (engine??) design processes represented as scenarios.

 
The development of complex software-intensive systems requires stakeholders from diverse domains to work in a coordinated manner on different aspects of the system. Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps in reducing the gap between heterogeneous domains using principles of separation of concerns, automatic generation and domain-specific languages (DSL). MDE is thus a potential solution to help develop systems collaboratively. In MDE, stakeholders work on models in order to design, transform, simulate, and analyze systems. Teams of stakeholders with varying expertise work together to produce a coherent and complete system. Therefore, there is a need for collaborative platforms to allow modelers to work together.
In this talk, I present the different research projects we have been working on in the topic of collaborative modeling in MDE. After laying a set of necessary requirements I address several topics. We will look at the data structures needed to ensure near real-time collaboration. We will see how multi-view modeling is essential to let users work on different aspects of the system concurrently. Having users from different domains and expertise, we show how to adapt the modeling environment specifically to the needs and habits of the user. We will discuss automatic generation of restrictive modeling IDEs that can support all sorts of user interaction modes.
