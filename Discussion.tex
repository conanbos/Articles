\section{Conclusions and future work}
This paper describes a collaborative design approach between system engineering methodology Arcadia (based on SysML) and architectural design language AADL (include hybrid annex) using transformation at metamodel level. We first present a formal description of key modeling elements of Arcadia, AADL, and hybrid annex, respectively. Then translation rules from these Arcadia metamodels to AADL are formally defined. Finally, we give the implementation procedures using ATL, and a case of train traction controlling system is used to demonstrate the transformation from engineering concerned design into an architectural refinement design which can be further analyzed on scheduling properties. 
In our future work, we will study the translation rules for more elements of Arcadia and also for comprehensive SysML elements, even for others UML-like profiles such as MARTE. At the same time, we will continue to explore the AADL and its annex to support more analysis and formal verification of system design. Besides, the safety-critical systems have become a trend in industrial files. We will study the extension of AADL with verification of safety properties with transformation methodology.
