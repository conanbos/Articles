\section{introduction}
Nowadays, A system becomes more and more complex which involved a number of aspect, especially, the Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), 


object-oriented  meta-languages such as MOF (Meta-Object Facility) are increasingly used to  specify domain-specific languages in  the   model-driven   engineering   community.   However,   these   meta-languages focus on structural specifications and have no built-in support for specifications 
of  operational  semantics.  In  this  paper  
we  explore  the  idea  of  using  aspect-
oriented modeling to add precise action specifications with stat
ic type checking 
and  genericity  at  the  meta  level,  a
nd  examine  related  issues  and  possible  
solutions. We believe that such a comb
ination would bring significant benefits 
to   the   community,   such   as   the   specification,   simulation   and   testing   of   
operational   semantics   of   
metamodels.   We   present   requirements   for   such   
statically-typed meta-languages and ra
tionales for the aforementioned benefits.
