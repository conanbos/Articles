\section{introduction}
The design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has become increasingly complex and challenging. The developer should face numerous aspects, and each aspect has their features and characteristics, as well as special modeling languages and platforms. The collaborative design is a potential approach to deal with the rise of the complexity of system design, attracting more and more attention from the industry and the scientific community. The collaborative design relied on Model-driven engineering (MDE) with involving several modeling languages (such as SysML, AADL, etc.) and using principles of separation of concerns as well as domain-specific languages (DSL). It makes stakeholders from diverse domains to work in a coordinated manner on different aspects of the system. It could help in reducing the gap between heterogeneous domains and making diverse expertise work together to produce a coherent and complete system. However, we are not able to integrate all of them into a mono design platform. Hence, we proposed a new approach to blending them seamlessly and extended their capabilities without extending development platform. 


Our approach works at the high-level and early stage of development. 


Therefore, there is a need for collaborative platforms to allow modelers to work together. We proposed a new approach to blending different languages seamlessly by manipulating metamodel with a set of transformation operators at the high-level and early stage of development. The process starts from a SysML system model, developed according to the platform-based design (PBD) paradigm, in which a functional model of the system (SW) is paired to a model of the execution platform (HW). Subsystems are refined as AADL models. In turn, AADL models are implemented as code and transfer to model-checker to perform verification and validation respectively. We illustrate our approach with an experimental of (engine??) design processes represented as scenarios.





The conception of multi-view design has been proposed to respond to currently complex system's requirements. It relied on Model-driven engineering (MDE) with involving several modeling languages (such as SysML, AADL, etc.) and using principles of separation of concerns as well as domain-specific languages (DSL) to make stakeholders from diverse domains to work in a coordinated manner on different aspects of the system. It could help in reducing the gap between heterogeneous domains and making diverse expertise work together to produce a coherent and complete system. Therefore, there is a need for collaborative platforms to allow modelers to work together. We proposed a new approach to blending different languages seamlessly by manipulating metamodel on the high-level and early stage of development. Firstly, we are established in engineering framework (Capella) which adopts SysML as a modeling language. Furthermore, we proposed a set of transformation operators that can construct an interpretation system to translate designs into AADL develop environment (OASTE) automatically, and then it can refine models and performance verification and validation respectively. We illustrate our approach with an experimental of (engine??) design processes represented as scenarios.


The process start from a SysML system model, developed according to
the platform-based design (PBD) paradigm, in which a functional model
of the system is paired to a model of the execution platform. Subsystems
are refined as Simulink models or hand coded in C++. In turn, Simulink
models are implemented as software code or firmware on FPGA, and an
automatic generation of the implementation is obtained. Based on the
SysML system architecture specification, our framework drives the gener-
ation of Simulink models with consistent interfaces, allows the automatic
generation of the communication code among all subsystems (including
the HW-FW interface code).

The conception of multi-view design has been proposed to respond to currently complex system's requirements. It relied on Model-based approach (MBA) and involved several modeling languages (such as SysML, AADL, etc.). However, we are not able to integrate all of them into a mono design platform. Hence, we proposed a new approach to blending them seamlessly and extended their capabilities without extending development platform, that we named co-design operation. Firstly, we are established in engineering framework --Capella which adopts SysML as a modeling language. Furthermore, we proposed a set of transformation operators that can construct an interpretation system to automatically translate  Capella designs into AADL develop environment (OASTE), and then it can refine models and performance verification and validation respectively. We illustrate our approach with an experimental of (engine??) design processes represented as scenarios.


Nowadays, A system becomes more and more complex which involved a number of aspects, especially, the Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) which is 


object-oriented  meta-languages such as MOF (Meta-Object Facility) are increasingly used to  specify domain-specific languages in  the   model-driven   engineering   community.   However,   these   meta-languages focus on structural specifications and have no built-in support for specifications 
of  operational  semantics.  In  this  paper  
we  explore  the  idea  of  using  aspect-
oriented modeling to add precise action specifications with stat
ic type checking 
and  genericity  at  the  meta  level,  a
nd  examine  related  issues  and  possible  
solutions. We believe that such a comb
ination would bring significant benefits 
to   the   community,   such   as   the   specification,   simulation   and   testing   of   
operational   semantics   of   
metamodels.   We   present   requirements   for   such   
statically-typed meta-languages and ra
tionales for the aforementioned benefits. 





However, we are not able to integrate all of them into a mono design platform. Hence, we proposed a new approach to blending them seamlessly and extended their capabilities without extending development platform, that we named co-design operation.
