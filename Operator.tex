%Ideally, all aspects play a equally important role, In practice however, one often chosen a base model as backbone on which other aspects are woven.  
%\subsection{Merging Models}
%To merge two models (Metamodels), we ought have one entry point whom is \textit{pointcut},  

%$<\mathring{A_s}, \wideparen{Sem}, CP, A_d>$, which $\mathring{A_s}$

We denote $sig$ the signature of an aspect $\mathcal{A}$. The signature of an aspect is a metamodel that describes all the features (\textit{i.e.}parametres, properties) defined.
